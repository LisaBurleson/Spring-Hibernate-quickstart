= 1. Use Lightweight Architectural Decision Records.

Date: 12/08/2019

== Status
proposed

== Context

Far to often we are plagued with architectural decisions in our application that were made on the fly and never documented or documentation when to some
digital graveyard, never to be seen again unless someone stumbles upon it.  By keeping a log of application architectural decisions near the code that most affected
by the changes, developers in the future can quickly scan for areas of technologies and see the decision making process that went into the move.
This ADR technique is an attempt to answer, *"why did they do it that way???"* or *"What the hell were they thinking??!?"*.

What is an architectural decision? Anything that is:

* a change in technology
* a new technique
* an upgrade in technology
* a new tool added to the developer stack, the application stack
* something removed from the system

== Decision
This technique has not been proposed to the group just yet.

== Consequences

What are the pros and cons?

=== Pros:
* there is an unambiguous record of architectural decisions
* developers will know *when* decisions was made
* the decisions are close to the code
* making decisions are more deliberate
* this documentation can supply customer documentation
* these decisions are also versioned with the code

=== Cons:
* it's more documentation
* sometimes making a decision consists of finding the first working solution to a problem
* some architectural decisions aren't recognized as an architectural decision
